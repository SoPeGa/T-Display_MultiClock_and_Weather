# T-Display Multi Clock and Weather
Navigate through date/time and weather data from different cities displayed on a T-Display S3 board.

This project is designed to display real-time weather information and current time for various cities on the T-Display S3 device. It utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and syncs time with an NTP server using the ESP32's internal clock. Users can switch between different cities to view their respective weather and time information. The device also features a button for toggling between time zones and a startup logo for visual feedback during initialization. Overall, the project provides a convenient and compact solution for staying updated on weather conditions and time across multiple locations.
